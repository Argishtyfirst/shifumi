# Shifumi

Shifumi is a web-based implementation of the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, built with React and Vite.

## Getting Started

To run Shifumi on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/argishtyfirst/shifumi.git`

2. Navigate into the `shifumi` directory:

   `cd shifumi`

3. Install the dependencies:

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3030`.

## Usage

To play Shifumi, simply choose one of the three image/buttons of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer will randomly select its own choice, and the winner will be displayed on the screen.
